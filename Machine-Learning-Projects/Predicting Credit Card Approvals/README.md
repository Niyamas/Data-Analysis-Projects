# Predicting-Credit-Card-Approvals
A logistic regression machine learning model is built and optimized to predict credit card approvals. The data is hosted on UCI's Machine Learning Repository titled:  Credit Approval Data Set

Many banks have adopted machine learning algorithms as part of their operations. It takes in multiple features such as age, gender, income, and credit score. It uses this data to make a prediction on whether to approve someone for a credit card. Given enough quality data, machine learning algorithms can spot trends otherwise not seen by the human eye and make a call on an application. The following notebook will focus on creating a logistic regression algorithm to make these predictions.
