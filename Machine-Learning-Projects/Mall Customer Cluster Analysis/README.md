# Mall-Customer-Cluster-Analysis
A cluster analysis using K-means, an unsupervised machine learning method, was used on a sample mall customer dataset to create insightful groupings among the customers.

The dataset and analysis was provided by Nafisur Rahman from Softweb Solutions Inc. His analysis and the dataset can be found here on Kaggle: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/nafisur/customer-segmentation-analysis-cluster-analysis)

The dataset can also be downloaded through this repository. It's called: 'Mall_Customers.csv'.

The analysis was done on Jupyter Notebook and can be found by opening the 'Mall Customer Cluster Analysis using K-means.ipynb' file. If you plan on running the file, you will need to change the filepath in order for you to load the file.
