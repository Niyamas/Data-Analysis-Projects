# Pump-it-Up-Data-Data-Mining-the-Water-Table
A random forest classifier was built to predict water pump functionality in Tanzania, an arid country in eastern Africa. Knowing which pumps require maintenance will help initiatives allocate resources to those pumps. The data and competition is hosted on drivendata.org: [Link](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/).

A special thanks to Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water for providing the data.

Please see the ipynb file titled: "Pump it Up Notebook.ipynb" for the analysis and classification algorithm. This was part of a final project for class so if you'd like to see the powerpoint, it's also here. Thanks for reading!
