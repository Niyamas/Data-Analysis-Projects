# House Price Prediction Using XGBoost
Provides a step-by-step walk-through of the methods used to analyze the dataset originally provided by Dean De Cock. The link to Kaggle can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). XGBoost was the algorithm used to predict sale prices, given a number of records and their features.

The techniques in the notebook produced a root mean log square error (RMSE) of 0.12850 on the test data. This value is the standard deviation of the residuals, which are a measure of the data points from the regression line.
