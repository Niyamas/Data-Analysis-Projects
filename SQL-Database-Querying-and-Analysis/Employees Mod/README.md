# Employees_mod-Database-Analysis
The database is from the MySQL for Data Analytics and Business Intelligence class by 365 Careers on Udemy.com. MySQL was used to query the database. A business intelligence dashboard was created in Tableau public.

These are the steps taken to create the BI dashboard:
1. Download the employees_mod database.
2. Download the files in the tasks folder.
3. (Optional) Use the SQL files to output each task solution's as a CSV file and go to step 5.
4. Download task 1-4 CSV files from the tasks folder.
5. Use Tableau Public to recreate the graphs found on [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/andrei3087#!/).

The resulting BI dashboard can be found by downloading the 'BI Dashboard (from the employees_mod database).twbx' file. You will need Tabeau to view this. An alternative method for viewing the final dashboard is by following this [link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/andrei3087#!/vizhome/BIDashboardfromtheemployees_moddatabase/Dashboard1).
