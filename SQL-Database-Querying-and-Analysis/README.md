# SQL-Database-Querying-and-Analysis
PostgreSQL databases can be connected through Python using ipython-sql and sqlalchemy. Here are some jupyter notebooks containing examples of how SQL code can be integrated with Python.

Please see the DVD Rentals folder for an overview on the above methods.

Sometimes the ipynb file or its contents won't load, so a workaround is to use [Jupyter's nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and pasting the Github link to there.
