# DVD-Rentals-Database-Querying-and-Analysis
Instead of hopping between different programs, a SQL server can be connected to using the Python interface which allows one to right SQL code there. This can make the process of querying -> analysis more seamless.

## 1. PostgreSQL Examples With Python
Please see the notebook titled: "Using PostgreSQL in Python.ipynb" as a precursor on how to connect to a PostgreSQL database (Much of the code & inspiration is from Sayak Paul @ DataCamp).

## 2. Querying the DVD Rentals Database
http://www.postgresqltutorial.com provides an example DVD rentals database and how to download it onto a PostgreSQL database. Example queries are made in the notebook: "SQL Practice on DVD Rental Database.ipynb"

## 3. Combining Tableau with Jupyter
Tableau visualizations can be embedded in Jupyter where it's convenient to have since it provides the power of an interactive plot right in the notebook. Please see the notebook: "Querying the DVD Rental Database with Tableau Integration.ipynb" for an example of this.

The Tableau visuals will can't be viewed on Github, but does appear on Jupyter's nbviewer: [Link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Niyamas/SQL-Database-Querying-and-Analysis/blob/master/DVD%20Rentals/Querying%20the%20DVD%20Rental%20Database%20with%20Tableau%20Integration.ipynb)
